##Fraud Detection using Deep Learning 

###Paypal Usecase

Paypal used H2O Deep Learning Implementation for the fraud Detection. It turns out deep learning models are  good at identifying the complex patterns and characteristics of cybercrime and online fraud. Machine-learning-based pattern recognition has long been a major part of fraud detection practices.
